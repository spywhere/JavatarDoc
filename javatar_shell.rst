|J| Shell
=============

|J| shell is working like normal shell terminal.
The difference between |J| shell and another shells is |J| shell will send your input by pressing Enter/Return (that give you ability to reedit your content on current line).

While |J| shell is running, you can close the view to force quit any application that still running in the shell.

.. warning:: We cannot gurranteed that output or input is corrected when you are enter while |J| shell is printing an output from the shell since |J| shell did not set the view to read-only while printing.
