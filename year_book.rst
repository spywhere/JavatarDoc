A lookback of |J| over years...

15 June 2014...
---------------

Stats: 5.5k installs

It's been a year since |J| was released.
There're so many things that |J| has been added and improved over the year.
Started from a simple plugin that helps create a package and class easier, and becomes a more capable plugin to build and run Java projects.
1 year, many things changed, yet there're more to come...
